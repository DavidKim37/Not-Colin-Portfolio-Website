                    I was born in the harsh Australian outback, where it has never once rained and where is it is so hot
                    that it is biologically
                    impossible to feel joy. I was abandoned by my birth parents because they were scared of my abilities,
                    so I was raised by giant desert wolves.
                    My only solution to survive was to hack the sand in order to get the nutrients I needed, luckily the
                    desert wolves were adept at programming and taught me everything I know about computer science.
                    Eventually I evolved to have a computer integrated into my face, this reduced the latency between my
                    brain and the computer. On my 12th birthday I was tossed into the desert ocean as a coming of age
                    ceremony. <br>
                    The wolves called this "if(wolf.age >= 12){ wolf.position = ocean;}". In order to survive this trial,
                    I hacked the desert sharks and programmed them to drink all the desert ocean so I could escape. <br>
                    Victory <br>
                    At this point I was officially a desert Wolf Alpha. I was happy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2 years later something happened which changed my life forever. <br>
                    I was watering the desert ocean when I heard it, the terrifying roar of the desert Lions.<br>
                    I ran back to the desert wolf camp, when I saw the devastation.<br>
                    The desert Lion King had given a ted talk to every member of my pack, convincing them to use the
                    python programming language <br>
                    <strong>Oh the horror </strong><br>
                    The desert Lion King took off his glasses and stared directly into my monitor face and smiled as he
                    said "Look at these 1 line for loops"
                    <br>
                    "Python is for filthy casuals and always will be" I shouted, however my words fell on deaf ears,
                    the damage was already done.
                    <br>
                    I turned my back on the traitors which I had once called my pack and ran, ran as far as I could.
                    <br>
                    I escaped.
                    <br>
                    But the losses I experienced that day would haunt me forever.
                    <br>
                    I've spent every second of my remaining life in hiding. To pass the time I make youtube videos and
                    shitty websites, however one day my past will catch
                    up with me and when that day comes, I will fight to my very last semicolon against the wrath of the
                    Desert Lion King.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also like long walks on the beach and puppies.
